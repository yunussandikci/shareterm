**ShareTerm** is minimalistc, open source online terminal log sharing tool where the server has zero knowledge of pasted data.
It uses **client-side encryption** with AES-256 Bits. It fastens one simple process while you are developing, and **saves your time**. So that, you don't waste your time with trying to copy, paste, beautify. You **just pipe the `shareterm`** and it returns a simple shareble link.
